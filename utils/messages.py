Hi everyone! Thanks for waiting for the return of our Weekly Prompts, but with the addition of Screencap Redraws!

For weekly prompts, simply create a drawing related to any one of the themes we release this week!
For redraws, you may try recreating the image in your own style, use it as an educational study, swap out the characters entirely, or just make a silly parody! 

Use the screencaps as an easy way to start drawing without having to think too hard ðŸ˜„

This weekâ€™s prompts are: 

{{#prompts}}
{{id}} ... {{{emoji}}} **{{prompt}}**!
{{/prompts}}

And this week's screencap redraw is: 
**{{screencap_img_gdrive_desc}}**
